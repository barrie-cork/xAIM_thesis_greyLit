# Task 005 Updates - tRPC API Usage Fix

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing runtime errors due to incorrect usage of tRPC hooks. The root cause was identified as using tRPC mutations directly instead of through hooks.

## Implemented Solutions

1. **Created Documentation**
   - Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/trpc-best-practices.md` outlining the proper way to use tRPC in React components
   - Documented common pitfalls and best practices for tRPC usage

2. **Created Example Components**
   - Implemented `TRPCMutationExample.tsx` as a reference implementation of proper tRPC mutation usage
   - Created `SearchMutationExample.tsx` to demonstrate real-world usage with form handling

3. **Created Utility Hooks and Components**
   - Implemented `useTRPCMutation.ts` custom hook for standardized mutation handling
   - Created `MutationStateDisplay.tsx` component for consistent loading/error/success state display

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: Proper hook usage ensures mutations are integrated with React's rendering lifecycle
2. **Better Error Handling**: Standardized approach to error handling across the application
3. **Consistent UX**: Unified loading, error, and success states for all mutations
4. **Developer Experience**: Clear documentation and examples make it easier for developers to use tRPC correctly

## Next Steps

1. Identify any remaining components that might be using trpcClient directly
2. Update those components to use the proper hook-based approach
3. Add automated tests to verify proper tRPC usage
4. Consider adding ESLint rules to prevent direct usage of trpcClient in components
