# Task ID: 6
# Title: SERP Execution and Results Management
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement search execution and results processing system
# Details:
Create the search execution and results management system:

SERP Execution:
- Implement API integration (Serper, SerpAPI)
- Create query execution system with pagination
- Build result parsing and normalization
- Implement rate limiting and error handling
- Set up result storage and enrichment

Results Management:
- Create deduplication system:
  - URL normalization
  - Fuzzy title matching
  - Duplicate logging
- Implement result filtering
- Create result enrichment pipeline
- Build result storage and caching

Technical Requirements:
- Use string-similarity for fuzzy matching
- Implement efficient pagination
- Create proper error handling
- Set up result caching
- Implement proper logging

# Test Strategy:
- Test API integration reliability
- Verify deduplication accuracy
- Test pagination handling
- Performance test result processing
- Validate error handling

# Subtasks:
## 1. SERP API Integration and Query Execution [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core integration with search APIs and create the query execution system
### Details:
1. Set up API clients for Serper and SerpAPI with appropriate authentication
2. Create a unified interface for query execution that abstracts the specific API used
3. Implement pagination support for search results with proper cursor handling
4. Add configurable parameters for search types (web, news, images) and result count
5. Implement basic error handling for API failures and timeouts
6. Set up detailed logging for all API requests and responses

## 2. Rate Limiting and Error Handling System [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create robust rate limiting and comprehensive error handling for search APIs
### Details:
1. Implement token bucket algorithm for rate limiting API requests
2. Create retry mechanism with exponential backoff for failed requests
3. Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
4. Implement fallback mechanisms to switch between API providers if one fails
5. Create detailed error classification system (network errors, API errors, quota errors)
6. Set up monitoring and alerting for API health and quota usage
7. Implement request queuing for handling traffic spikes

## 3. Result Parsing, Normalization and Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Build the system to parse, normalize and store search results
### Details:
1. Create parsers for different API response formats (Serper, SerpAPI)
2. Implement a unified result schema to normalize data from different providers
3. Build URL normalization system (handle protocols, query parameters, trailing slashes)
4. Set up a database schema for storing search results
5. Implement efficient batch storage operations
6. Create TTL-based caching system for search results
7. Add metadata enrichment for basic result information (timestamp, source API, query context)

## 4. Deduplication and Filtering System [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Implement advanced deduplication and filtering for search results
### Details:
1. Integrate string-similarity library for fuzzy title matching
2. Implement URL normalization for exact URL matching
3. Create configurable similarity thresholds for title-based deduplication
4. Build logging system for duplicate detection with reasoning
5. Implement content-based filtering rules (keyword blacklists, domain filtering)
6. Create relevance scoring system to prioritize results
7. Build configuration system for customizable filtering rules

## 5. Result Enrichment Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Create the complete result enrichment pipeline for enhanced search results
### Details:
1. Implement content snippet extraction and cleaning
2. Add domain reputation and authority scoring
3. Create metadata enrichment (publish date extraction, author information)
4. Build category and topic classification for results
5. Implement sentiment analysis for result snippets
6. Create system for attaching custom tags and annotations
7. Build final result formatting with all enrichments for downstream consumption
8. Implement comprehensive metrics collection for result quality
