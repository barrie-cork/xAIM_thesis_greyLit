# Task ID: 4
# Title: Database Schema and API Layer Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up database schema, Prisma ORM, and tRPC API layer
# Details:
Implement database and API infrastructure:

Database Setup (✅ COMPLETED):
- ✅ Configure PostgreSQL in Supabase
- ✅ Create Prisma schema for all tables:
  - users
  - search_requests
  - search_results
  - review_tags
  - duplicate_log
- ✅ Set up database migrations
- ✅ Configure indexes for performance
- ✅ Implement Row Level Security (RLS)

API Layer (✅ COMPLETED):
- ✅ Set up tRPC server and router with auth context
- ✅ Create type-safe procedures for:
  - ✅ User authentication and profile management
  - ✅ Search strategy and saved searches
  - ✅ Results storage and deduplication
  - ✅ Review tagging and collaboration
- ✅ Implement proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Set up API documentation and testing

Data Models (✅ COMPLETED):
- ✅ Implement all data models as specified in database_architecture.md
- ✅ Set up proper relationships and foreign keys
- ✅ Configure JSONB fields for flexible metadata
- ✅ Implement proper data validation using Zod

# Test Strategy:
- Unit test all tRPC procedures
- Test database operations and relationships
- Verify type safety across the stack
- Performance testing for complex queries
- Test data validation and error handling
- Verify proper error logging and handling

## 4.6. Implement Data Validation Layer [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create Zod schemas for all data models and API inputs/outputs with proper validation rules
### Details:
- Implemented comprehensive Zod schemas for all data models in src/schemas/ directory
- Created dedicated schema files for each entity type (user, search, result, review)
- Added strict validation rules to ensure data integrity:
  - Email format validation for user emails
  - URL validation for search results
  - Schema validation for JSON metadata fields
  - Enum validation for search status and review tags
- Integrated schemas with tRPC input validation using .input() method

## 4.7. Set up Error Handling and Logging [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement global error handling, request logging, and proper error responses
### Details:
- Implemented centralized error handling middleware for tRPC procedures
- Created custom error classes to differentiate between error types:
  - ValidationError: For input validation failures
  - AuthorizationError: For permission issues
  - NotFoundError: For requested resources that don't exist
  - ConflictError: For duplicate entries or conflicting operations
  - RateLimitError: For exceeding API rate limits
- Added detailed error logging with context information
- Implemented client-friendly error messages that don't expose sensitive details
- Set up request logging with anonymized sensitive data
- Added performance measurement for long-running operations
- Configured proper HTTP status codes for different error types
- Created middleware to handle database connection errors gracefully
- Implemented retry logic for transient errors
- Added transaction support for multi-step operations
- Set up monitoring hooks for critical errors


## 4.8. Create API Documentation and Testing Suite [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Generate API documentation using tRPC-OpenAPI and implement comprehensive testing
### Details:
- Set up API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger:
  - Created OpenAPI specification generator in src/server/api-docs.ts
  - Implemented Swagger UI endpoint at /api/swagger
  - Added documentation page with redirect at /documentation
  - Documented all API endpoints with parameters, request bodies, and responses
  - Added examples and descriptions for improved clarity
- Implemented comprehensive testing suite:
  - Created Jest configuration with ts-jest for TypeScript support
  - Set up test environment in src/test/setup.ts
  - Implemented mock factories for test data generation
  - Created utility functions for testing in src/test/utils/
  - Added unit tests for all tRPC procedures:
    - User API tests (authentication, profile management)
    - Search API tests (creation, retrieval, updates)
    - Results API tests (storage, retrieval, deduplication)
    - Review API tests (tagging, collaboration features)
  - Implemented test isolation with database mocking
  - Added test coverage reporting
  - Created test documentation in src/test/README.md
- Ensured consistent error handling in tests:
