# Task ID: 6
# Title: SERP Execution and Results Management - Action Plan
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Prioritized action plan for completing the search execution and results processing system

# Background
This task covers the implementation of search execution and results management system. The core functionality has been implemented, including:
- API integration with search providers
- Result parsing and normalization
- Deduplication system with advanced URL normalization
- Result storage and caching
- Filtering and enrichment pipeline

The current implementation is more advanced than initially described, with features like:
- Weighted fuzzy matching (50% title, 30% snippet, 20% URL)
- Configurable merge strategies for duplicate handling
- Advanced URL normalization with multiple options
- Type system improvements for SearchResult interfaces

# Prioritized Action Plan

## 1. Unit Testing (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- Implement comprehensive unit tests for all filter types:
  - Domain/source filtering
  - Content type filtering
  - Keyword filtering
  - Date/freshness filtering
  - Custom filter rules
- Create tests for each enrichment module:
  - Metadata enrichment
  - Content type detection
  - Entity extraction
  - Relevance scoring
- Test edge cases in deduplication:
  - Very similar titles with different content
  - Same content with different URLs
  - Corner cases in URL normalization
- Verify string similarity algorithm with various thresholds

## 2. Performance Optimization (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Benchmark deduplication with large result sets (1000+ results)
- Optimize string similarity algorithm implementation
- Profile and improve cache performance:
  - Cache hit/miss ratio monitoring
  - Query fingerprinting effectiveness
  - Storage requirements
- Measure and optimize enrichment pipeline throughput
- Implement pagination performance tests

## 3. Documentation Updates (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Document the type system resolution (SearchResult interfaces)
- Create diagrams for search execution flow
- Update API documentation for search service
- Document available configuration options:
  - Deduplication thresholds and strategies
  - Caching options
  - Filter rule configuration
- Create usage examples for practical scenarios
- Update CHANGELOG with detailed implementation notes

## 4. Integration Testing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Create end-to-end tests for the complete pipeline
- Test real-world search scenarios across providers
- Verify pagination handling:
  - Next page token management
  - Result combining across pages
- Test cache invalidation strategies
- Implement error simulation tests
- Verify rate limiting enforcement

## 5. Code Cleanup (LOWER PRIORITY)
- Review naming conventions for consistency
- Ensure all configuration options are properly documented
- Remove any dead code or duplicate implementations
- Refine error handling and logging
- Update inline code comments
- Review TypeScript typing for improved safety

# Implementation Guidance

## Testing Strategy
- Use Jest/Vitest for unit tests
- Create mock data for API responses
- Separate pure function tests from integration tests
- Aim for 90%+ coverage of core functionality
- Test configuration changes to verify adaptability

## Performance Goals
- Deduplication should process 1000 results in under 500ms
- Cache hit rate should exceed 80% for common queries
- API response time should be under 200ms for cached results
- Enrichment pipeline should process results in under 100ms per batch

## Key Files to Focus On
- `src/lib/search/deduplication.ts`: Core deduplication logic
- `src/lib/search/filtering/`: Filter implementation
- `src/lib/search/search-service.ts`: Main service orchestration
- `src/lib/search/common-types.ts`: Type definitions
- `src/lib/search/result-resolver.ts`: Type conversion utilities

## Dependencies and Libraries
- Use built-in JavaScript string comparison or dedicated libraries
- Leverage existing URL parsing utilities for normalization
- Consider using worker threads for heavy processing

# Success Criteria
- All unit tests passing
- Performance goals met
- Documentation complete and up-to-date
- Integration tests passing
- Code meets quality standards
- No TypeScript errors or warnings
- Functionality matches or exceeds GitHub task description
