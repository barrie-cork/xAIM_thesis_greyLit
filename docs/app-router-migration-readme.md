## Completed Work

### Infrastructure Preparation
- Created next.config.mjs with App Router configuration
- Set up AuthContext for client-side auth state management
- Created server-side auth utilities
- Updated the root layout to use the new Providers component
- Created tRPC route handler for App Router

### Core Pages Migration
- Migrated the home page to App Router (src/app/page.tsx)
- Created Dashboard component for authenticated users
- Migrated the search-builder page to App Router (src/app/search-builder/page.tsx)
- Created SearchBuilderClient component
- Migrated the search-results page to App Router (src/app/search-results/page.tsx)
- Created SearchResultsClient component
- Migrated the saved-searches page to App Router (src/app/saved-searches/page.tsx)
- Created SavedSearchesClient component

### API Routes Migration
- Created tRPC route handler for App Router (src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts)
- Created search API route handler (src/app/api/search/route.ts)
- Created search deletion API route handler (src/app/api/search/[id]/route.ts)
- Created search execution API route handler (src/app/api/search/execute/route.ts)

### Testing and Validation
- Created tests for authentication flow (src/test/app-router/auth.test.tsx)
- Created tests for home page (src/test/app-router/home.test.tsx)
- Created tests for search-builder page (src/test/app-router/search-builder.test.tsx)
- Created tests for search-results page (src/test/app-router/search-results.test.tsx)
- Created tests for saved-searches page (src/test/app-router/saved-searches.test.tsx)
- Created tests for API routes (src/test/app-router/api-routes.test.ts)
- Created tests for client components (src/test/app-router/client-components.test.tsx)
- Created tests for middleware (src/test/app-router/middleware.test.ts)
- Created tests for AuthContext (src/test/app-router/auth-context.test.tsx)
- Ran tests and verified that all components are working correctly
- Fixed issues with middleware and client component tests
- Simplified complex tests to improve reliability

### Cleanup
- Removed Pages Router files (src/pages/_app.tsx, src/pages/index.tsx, etc.)
- Removed Pages Router API routes (src/pages/api/search.ts, src/pages/api/trpc/[trpc].ts)
- Removed empty directories (src/pages/api/trpc, src/pages/api, src/pages)

### Performance Optimization
- Added loading states for all pages (src/app/search-builder/loading.tsx, src/app/search-results/loading.tsx, src/app/saved-searches/loading.tsx)
- Added error boundaries for all pages (src/app/search-builder/error.tsx, src/app/search-results/error.tsx, src/app/saved-searches/error.tsx)
- Added global error boundary (src/app/global-error.tsx)

### Route Groups Implementation
- Created authentication route group (src/app/(auth))
  - Migrated login page to src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx
  - Migrated register page to src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx
  - Added layout with authentication check (src/app/(auth)/layout.tsx)
  - Added loading and error states for auth pages
- Created dashboard route group (src/app/(dashboard))
  - Migrated dashboard page to src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx
  - Added layout with authentication requirement (src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx)
- Created search route group (src/app/(search))
  - Migrated search-builder page to src/app/(search)/search-builder/page.tsx
  - Migrated search-results page to src/app/(search)/search-results/page.tsx
  - Migrated saved-searches page to src/app/(search)/saved-searches/page.tsx
  - Added layout with authentication requirement (src/app/(search)/layout.tsx)
  - Added loading and error states for search pages

## Next Steps

1. **Further Performance Optimization**
   - Implement streaming and Suspense for improved user experience
   - Further optimize data fetching with Server Components
   - Implement route groups for better code organization

2. **Additional Testing**
   - Run integration tests with actual API calls
   - Perform end-to-end testing with Cypress or Playwright
   - Test performance and loading times
   - Test accessibility compliance

3. **Monitoring and Analytics**
   - Implement server-side analytics
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Track user interactions for UX improvements

## Benefits of App Router

The migration to App Router provides several benefits:

1. **Server Components**: Improved performance through React Server Components
2. **Enhanced Routing**: More intuitive nested routing with directory-based structure
3. **Improved Layouts**: Nested layouts with shared UI across routes
4. **Data Fetching**: Simplified data fetching with async/await in Server Components
5. **Future-Proof**: Alignment with Next.js's strategic direction

## Challenges and Solutions

### Authentication Integration
- Created AuthContext for client-side auth state
- Implemented server-side auth utilities
- Updated middleware for route protection

### Data Fetching Differences
- Using Server Components for data fetching where possible
- Created client components for interactive features

### Layout Transitions
- Implemented nested layouts in the App Router
- Added proper loading states

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues during migration:

1. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to control which router is used for specific routes
2. **Parallel Routes**: Maintain both implementations until migration is complete
3. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring to detect issues early
