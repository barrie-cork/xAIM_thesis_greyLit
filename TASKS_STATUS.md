## 🔍 Implementation Notes
The search builder now uses a simplified approach without MeSH term dependencies, making it easier to maintain and extend. Search queries are generated based on concept groups with proper Boolean logic (AND between concepts, OR within concepts).

Each trusted domain now gets its own dedicated search query instead of being combined with OR logic, allowing for more targeted searches per domain. The preview section includes the ability to see all queries at once and execute them individually.
