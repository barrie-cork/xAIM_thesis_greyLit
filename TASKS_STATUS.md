## 🔍 Implementation Notes

### UI System and Documentation
The application now features a comprehensive UI system with detailed documentation. Key improvements include:

#### Authentication and UI Design
- Updated middleware to correctly handle authentication and route protection
- Fixed API context to properly integrate with Supabase Auth
- Ensured consistent session handling across the application
- Resolved issues with cookie handling and session management
- Implemented proper cleanup of user data in both Supabase Auth and application database
- Created a dedicated landing page for unauthenticated users
- Improved navigation flow between landing page, login, and registration
- Added proper redirection to landing page after logout

#### UI Component System
- Created shared AuthLayout component for consistent styling
- Implemented consistent color scheme and visual elements across the application
- Enhanced form validation and error displays with improved user feedback
- Added responsive design for better mobile experience
- Fixed component duplication and conflicts
- Ensured global CSS is properly imported in the application layout
- Updated Button, Input, and Label components with consistent styling

#### UI Documentation
- Created detailed UI guidelines document with design principles
- Added component examples document with practical code snippets
- Created Storybook setup guide for component development
- Added README for the UI components directory
- Documented best practices for maintaining UI consistency

### Search Builder
The search builder now uses a simplified approach without MeSH term dependencies, making it easier to maintain and extend. Search queries are generated based on concept groups with proper Boolean logic (AND between concepts, OR within concepts).

Each trusted domain now gets its own dedicated search query instead of being combined with OR logic, allowing for more targeted searches per domain. The preview section includes the ability to see all queries at once and execute them individually.

### App Router Migration
The application is being migrated from Next.js Pages Router to App Router architecture for improved performance and future-proofing. Progress includes:

- ✅ Created next.config.mjs with App Router configuration
- ✅ Set up AuthContext for client-side auth state management
- ✅ Created server-side auth utilities
- ✅ Updated the root layout to use the new Providers component
- ✅ Migrated the home page to App Router
- ✅ Migrated the search-builder page to App Router
- ✅ Migrated the search-results page to App Router
- ✅ Migrated the saved-searches page to App Router
- ✅ Created API route handlers for search functionality
- ✅ Created comprehensive tests for migrated components
- ✅ Ran tests and verified that all components are working correctly
- ✅ Removed Pages Router files
- ✅ Fixed failing tests
- ✅ Added loading states for all pages
- ✅ Added error boundaries for all pages
- ✅ Implemented route groups for better code organization
